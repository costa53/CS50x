                <h1 class="h1">Android Mascot History</h1>
                <p>
                    You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices in the world. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.
                </p>
                <h2 class="h2">The first version</h2>
                <p>
                    The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/" target="_blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to impersonate the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.

                <p>
                    The first bizarre version was named in honor of its creator: they would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.
                </p>
                <h2 class="h2">A new mascot appears</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of having a mascot was maturing and a mission was given to a professional in the area. The russian designer <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.

                <p>
                    Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with the viewer. The came the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new mascot of Android.
                </p>
                <img src="img/bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="Bugdroid">
                <p>
                    The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little dools that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. The legend says that the artist was creating at her desk at Google's office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

                        Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                        <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                        <li>2.1 - Eclair</li>
                        <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                        <li>2.3 - BiGingerbread</li>
                        <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                        <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                        <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                        <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                        <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                        <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                        <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                        <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                        <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put and end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.
